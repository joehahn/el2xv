These IDL procedures convert Keplerian orbit elements into Cartesian coordinates and 
velocities, and back. The file test_el2xv.pro performs a few test calculations, and
also illustrates the codes' usage. These codes also execute sucessfully in GDL (yay!),
which is the open Gnu equivalent to IDL. To execute, start IDL or GDL and enter @test_xv2el
